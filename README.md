# üçö Cooking GNOME
This is my first rice ever! I wanted it to be aesthetically pleasing, but also very usable. It may still have some inconsistencies here and there, however, its current state is what I could have done without a massive time consuming effort. 

You may have to tweak a lot of the extensions to get the same results, but here are all the things I used. It would be a pleasure if someone uses my dot files!
